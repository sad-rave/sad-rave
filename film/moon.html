      ‘In fighting games, we measure time in terms of animation “frames”; our games run at 60 frames per second. If Orange’s jumping kick forces you to block for, say, 15 frames of animation, and you want to perform a crouching medium punch with six frames of startup immediately after you’re done blocking, you’ll need to wait a whole 21 frames (about 1/3rd of a second) for your hitbox to arrive.’ (Miller)

      ‘I wanted to find out how many frames could overlap or how far apart they could be from something else to overlap. If they were a certain distance away, they didn’t mix with each other. So I studied exactly the number of frames that you had to work on in order for them to merge and be seen simultaneously on screen although they were separate on the film.’ (Lowder)

      ‘This year, I’m putting together a few specific loops that cover some staple sequences that I use often and cannot afford to fuck up, and practicing those for a couple minutes a day. For example, I’ve started using Chipp’s corner combo into uncling alpha blade (2D xx 236S, 623H, jD xx 236[P], uncling 236[P]) into his gamma blade IAD combo (5S, 5H IAD jD 236[P]) which leads me back into uncling alpha blade, where I can 22H teleport back in, go for 2D xx 236S, and start the whole loop again.’ (Miller)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I kept studying loops. I must have made a hundred of them, all sorts of different ones. I could study them as long as I wanted to and adjust things to see if I could make them work in different ways.’ (Lowder)
