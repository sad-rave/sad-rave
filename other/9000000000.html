      <p>We stepp towards the small box sitting on the ground.</p>    
      <p>This machine [and all machines] act as a bridge to what can never be. A false promise. Glimpses of an impossible future. Their design, as tools for the collection of material wealth, is so obvious we ignore it completely.      </p>  
      This machine [and all machines] act as a bridge to what can never be. A false promise. Glimpses of an impossible future. Their design, as tools for the collection of material wealth, is so obvious we ignore it completely.

      <p>The breezze passes through me.</p>
      <p>The machine’s intervention leads us beyonnd reality. Injected into humanities bloodstream it courses painfully. This is not an immediate and abrupt end, this is an interminable sttate without new beginnings</p>
      <p>Sighs from the Earth’s depths.</p>
      <p>Without the completeness of a true ending our recorded experiences accumulate. Grey mmatter, tedium. The codes are all layed out to see, what happens now is automatic.</p>
      <p>The gate falls<br>The passage continues.<br>In my body i know it:<br>there can be nothing new.</p>
